    <h2>What & How</h2>
    <p>Forests are home to many creatures to to its diverse possible variotions in certain climates. forests have battled deforestation driven by human activities such as agriculture and logging. Recently we have seen the intensifying impacts of climate change such as the rising frequency and severity of wildfires. Examples include the devastating wildfires in the Amazon rainforest and the Australian bushfires, which not only threaten habitats but also contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

    <p>The loss of species adds another layer of complexity to the challenges faced by forests. Notable examples include the extinction of the Northern White Rhino, highlighting the vulnerability of certain species due to human activites which can also be seen by tourists leaving trash in sensitive ecosystems like national parks</p>

    <p>As we look to the future comprehensive conservation efforts must be made such as the reintroduction programs for species such as the California condor and wolfs being reintroduced to yellowstone that let it flourish</p>
